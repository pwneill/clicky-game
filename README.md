# clicky-game

A React-based application based on the game "Memory". Users can click a potential (or announced) 2020 Presidential candidate to score points. However, if the User clicks the same candidate more than once, the game is over and their score is reset. 

A live version of the game can be found at:  https://pwneill.github.io/clicky-game/. Users can also clone the repository, install the relevant node packages and then run "npm start" to launch the game on their local server.

This project is powered using Bootstrap and React.
